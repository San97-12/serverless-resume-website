# Cloud Resume Challenge

## Project Overview

Built and deployed a personal resume website with a serverless backend to track real-time visitor counts.

The frontend is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and the backend is powered by **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **API Gateway**. Visitor count is fetched via JavaScript and displayed dynamically on the page. CI/CD is configured using **GitHub Actions** to automatically deploy changes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  
- **Other**: IAM (permissions), CORS configuration
